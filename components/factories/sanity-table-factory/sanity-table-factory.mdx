<Description />

As with other Factory components, the Sanity Table Factory is a wrapper around the Table component and all of its child
components and provides a set of props that can be used to generate a working Table without having to handle any of the
complexity of the components themselves.

<Primary />

<Controls />

The SanityTableFactory can take `InfoTable` data from SanityCMS and render it as a table.

<Tip type="note">
  This is an extension of the TableFactory component but modified to work with
  SanityCMS data. Take a look at the
  [TableFactory](?path=/docs/components-factories-table-factory--docs) component
  for more information and additional examples.
</Tip>

## Table Headers

You can disable headers completely by setting the firstRowHeader prop to false.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithoutHeaderRow} />

## Table Sorting

You can also enable sorting on all columns by passing `sortable` an array with just '\*' as the only value.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Sortable} />

## Table Filtering

You can also enable filtering on all columns by passing an array with just '\*' to the `filterable` prop.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Filterable} />
